&lt;p&gt;This is an Etruscan burial chamber, and was named the &lt;em&gt;Tomb of the Augur&lt;/em&gt; because the figure on the right wall were observed as Roman priest which is known as an augur.
The walls were painted sometime between 530-520 BCE by an Ionian Greek painter. This tomb also displays depictions of funerary rites and rituals instead of mythology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tomb-layout-and-description&quot;&gt;Tomb Layout and Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chamber was decorated with a figurative on all four walls. This fresco consisted of plants and animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;back-wall&quot;&gt;Back wall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The back wall is painted with a door in the middle and two men on either side of it. The men were fist interpreted as augurs, hence giving the tomb its name. Later, it was believed that they may actually be mourners as this scene depicts a funerary ritual. The doors in this case are either there to represent the ‘doors’ to the underworld, or a symbol as the door to the tomb. Above the door is an image of a lion and a leopard attacking a gazelle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;right-wall&quot;&gt;Right wall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wall depicts funerary games, and more specifically in the center is a wrestling scene. To the left of them is a man who is observing them and is most likely a referee. There is another man next to him in fancy robes standing over two smaller men. This man can be interpreted as the deceased man coming back to watch the funerary games. The smaller men are most likely slaves or servants and they were usually depicted as smaller figures to represent as being beneath the upper class or their masters. One of them is sitting on the ground and appears to be weeping, perhaps mourning over the death of his master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;left-wall&quot;&gt;Left wall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the center there are two boxers and in between them a plant growing. to the right of them is a &lt;em&gt;phersu&lt;/em&gt;, which is an Etruscan word meaning ‘mask’ or ‘masked man’. The depiction of the phersu is debated by scholars. Some say he is dancing in among the vegetation, and others say he is running away from the boxers as a part of some sort of funerary game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an Etruscan burial chamber in Tarquinia, and has one of the best-preserved murals in Tarquinia. It is named the &lt;em&gt;Tomb of the Leopards&lt;/em&gt; because of the two leopards painted above the banquet scene on the back wall. This tombs dates to around 480-450 BCE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tomb-layout-and-description&quot;&gt;Tomb Layout and Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tomb was painted with people, plants, and animals on all four walls. The mural draws your attention to the main piece, which is the back wall, and the ceiling. It was painted very elaborately and with many bright colors that have stayed vivid and have been well-preserved over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;back-wall&quot;&gt;Back wall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the back wall is a banquet scene with three couples and two servants. The women are depicted with fair skin and the men with a darker complexion. The two servants are in front of them wearing no clothes and carrying tools for serving them. The couple on the left is having their own conversation and the lady appears to be holding or giving the man a crown of laurel. The couple in the middle is listening to the conversation happening  on the right. Where the man on the far right is depicted giving the women an egg as a sign of life and death. These people on the walls could be a depiction of the family of the deceased at a funeral banquet. There are plants painted all around them giving the impression that it was outside in a rural landscape. Above them are the leopards for which this tomb is called, also surrounded by plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Tarquinia_Tomb_of_the_Leopards.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;right-wall&quot;&gt;Right wall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wall displays dancers and musicians. The dancer is depicted wearing a light tebenna to allow for easy movement and is carrying a kylix. In the middle is a musician playing the aulos and to the right of him is a musician playing the lyre. Again they are surrounded by plants giving the impression that this is all taking place in a rural landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.historytoday.com/sites/default/files/reviews/etruscan.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;left-wall&quot;&gt;Left wall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here there are several servants depicted carrying things like a kylix, oenochoe, leaves of an olive tree, a ladle and a fan. They also appear to be walking over to the main wall where the three couples are lounging.&lt;/p&gt;
