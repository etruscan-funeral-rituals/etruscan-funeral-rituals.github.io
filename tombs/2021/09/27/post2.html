It is named the <em>Tomb of the Leopards</em> because of the two leopards painted above the banquet scene on the back wall. This tombs dates to around 480-450 BCE.</p> <h2 id="tomb-layout-and-description">Tomb Layout and Description</h2> <p>This tomb was painted with people, plants, and animals on all four walls. The mural draws your attention to the main piece, which is the back wall, and the ceiling. It was painted very elaborately and with many bright colors that have stayed vivid and have been well-preserved over the years.</p> <h3 id="back-wall">Back wall</h3> <p>On the back wall is a banquet scene with three couples and two servants. The women are depicted with fair skin and the men with a darker complexion. The two servants are in front of them wearing no clothes and carrying tools for serving them. The couple on the left is having their own conversation and the lady appears to be holding or giving the man a crown of laurel. The couple in the middle is listening to the conversation happening on the right. Where the man on the far right is depicted giving the women an egg as a sign of life and death. These people on the walls could be a depiction of the family of the deceased at a funeral banquet. There are plants painted all around them giving the impression that it was outside in a rural landscape. Above them are the leopards for which this tomb is called, also surrounded by plants.</p> <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Tarquinia_Tomb_of_the_Leopards.jpg" width="600"></p> <h3 id="right-wall">Right wall</h3> <p>This wall displays dancers and musicians. The dancer is depicted wearing a light tebenna to allow for easy movement and is carrying a kylix. In the middle is a musician playing the aulos and to the right of him is a musician playing the lyre. Again they are surrounded by plants giving the impression that this is all taking place in a rural landscape.</p> <p><img src="https://www.historytoday.com/sites/default/files/reviews/etruscan.jpg"></p> <h3 id="left-wall">Left wall</h3> <p>Here there are several servants depicted carrying things like a kylix, oenochoe, leaves of an olive tree, a ladle and a fan. They also appear to be walking over to the main wall where the three couples are lounging.</p> <p><img src="/images/Lt_leopards2.PNG"></p> <hr> <hr> <h2 id="key-words">Key words</h2> <p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/aulos">Aulos</a><br> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/kylix">Kylix</a><br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco">Fresco</a><br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oenochoe">Oenochoe</a></p> <hr> <hr> <h2 id="important-links">Important Links</h2> <p><a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/909329995">Monterozzi Necropolis</a><br> <a href="http://tarchna.tarchna.it/totemonline/">Virtual maps of the tombs</a></p> </div> </article> </div> </main> <footer id="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <div class="h5 pt-4">The Etruscan Funeral</div> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-lg-3"> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li class="text-secondary"> The Etruscan Funeral </li> <li><a href="mailto:mw4900@nyu.edu">mw4900@nyu.edu</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="col-12 col-lg"> <p class="text-secondary text-justify">This website explores some insight into the Etruscan burial practice.
