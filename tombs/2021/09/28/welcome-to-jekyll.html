The walls were painted sometime between 530-520 BCE by an Ionian Greek painter. This tomb also displays depictions of funerary rites and rituals instead of mythology.</p> <h2 id="tomb-layout-and-description">Tomb Layout and Description</h2> <p>The chamber was decorated with a figurative on all four walls. This fresco consisted of plants and animals.</p> <h3 id="back-wall">Back wall</h3> <p>The back wall is painted with a door in the middle and two men on either side of it. The men were fist interpreted as augurs, hence giving the tomb its name. Later, it was believed that they may actually be mourners as this scene depicts a funerary ritual. The doors in this case are either there to represent the ‘doors’ to the underworld, or a symbol as the door to the tomb. Above the door is an image of a lion and a leopard attacking a gazelle.</p> <p><img src="https://www.heritage-print.com/p/731/wall-tomb-augurs-tomba-degli-auguri-tarquinia-19667127.jpg" width="500"></p> <h3 id="right-wall">Right wall</h3> <p>This wall depicts funerary games, and more specifically in the center is a wrestling scene. To the left of them is a man who is observing them and is most likely a referee. There is another man next to him in fancy robes standing over two smaller men. This man can be interpreted as the deceased man coming back to watch the funerary games. The smaller men are most likely slaves or servants and they were usually depicted as smaller figures to represent as being beneath the upper class or their masters. One of them is sitting on the ground and appears to be weeping, perhaps mourning over the death of his master.</p> <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Tomb_of_the_augurs.jpg" width="500"></p> <h3 id="left-wall">Left wall</h3> <p>In the center there are two boxers and in between them a plant growing. to the right of them is a <em>phersu</em>, which is an Etruscan word meaning ‘mask’ or ‘masked man’. The depiction of the phersu is debated by scholars. Some say he is dancing in among the vegetation, and others say he is running away from the boxers as a part of some sort of funerary game.</p> <p><img src="https://alchetron.com/cdn/tomb-of-the-augurs-b6f894de-7ef7-4057-a483-df87e9430be-resize-750.jpg"></p> <hr> <hr> <h2 id="key-words">Key words</h2> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur">Augur</a><br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco">Fresco</a><br> <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100322222">Phersu</a></p> <hr> <hr> <h2 id="important-links">Important Links</h2> <p><a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/909329995">Monterozzi Necropolis</a><br> <a href="http://tarchna.tarchna.it/totemonline/">Virtual maps of the tombs</a></p> </div> </article> </div> </main> <footer id="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <div class="h5 pt-4">The Etruscan Funeral</div> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-lg-3"> <ul class="list-unstyled"> <li class="text-secondary"> The Etruscan Funeral </li> <li><a href="mailto:mw4900@nyu.edu">mw4900@nyu.edu</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="col-12 col-lg"> <p class="text-secondary text-justify">This website explores some insight into the Etruscan burial practice.
